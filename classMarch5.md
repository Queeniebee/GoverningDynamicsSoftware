Beware of the Turing Tarpit
===========================

* Modularity is not part of the computer science theory canon

>> Idea for language
a collaged program

interactive programming is making a resurgence. Was popular in the 50s and 60s. Being able to interact with an environment live is really powerful. What Alan Kay was trying to do with SmallTalk


#### For next week, make a game using [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.com)

#### Control Structures

If, while, case, switch for example]

### Expression vs Statement
Statements aere the control structure key word; expressions are anything else. Most impofytsnly they cannot be assigned values
only just reurn

 Ruby everything is an expression, however making distinction between expression vs statements is unnecessarily time consuming

* Different ways of control flow

**A language that complies the code into collage; like the canvas size is set to random and then crops out certain parts of the sketch***

The key in writing a parser is that you want to the take text and parse into a data structure of your choice: a tree, a linked list, an array.
AST: Abstract system tree

* A linked list is a series of nodes connected, like an array but the nodes are not near each other
* A tree is like a linked list but the nodes know the next one's location
* A graph allows for cycles

* being able to pass and store blocks of code is very valuable
