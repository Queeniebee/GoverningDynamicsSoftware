Lecture by Kovas Boguta
======================

A Mathematica "session" is a tree.

Mathematica is about symbolic mathematics

* symbols and trees, symbols and trees

"a model of infinite evaluation"
    * most evaluation models are applicative

Wolfram Language: 
    - philosophy that language should contain things of the world 
    - has a bunch of statistics baked into the language

*Need to use the IPython Notebook, finally*
* Session is closest to the language idea I want to achieve.
