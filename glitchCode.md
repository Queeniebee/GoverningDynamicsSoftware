```
Set window size to 500 by 500 pixels
Set the background of the window to beige

set a variable named COUNTER to 500
set a variable named X to 1
set a variable named FILL to 0
set a variable named STROKE to 0.1


This is a loop
While the COUNTER variable is greater than 0
    draw a square in the center of the window size 10
    set the square's fill color to FILL 
    rotate the square 15 degrees
    set the square's stroke color to blue
    multiply the stroke color by STROKE
    set the square's stroke size to STROKE
    multiply STROKE by X
    add 1 to X
    subtract 1 from COUNTER

Repeat this loop until the While statement is false
```
